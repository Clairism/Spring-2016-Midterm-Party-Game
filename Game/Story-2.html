		<img src="uploads/soft.jpeg"> 's birthday party was a disaster.
		<br /> It stated going downhill when <span id="player2-output"></span> arrived, bringing a <span id="dirty-output"></span> as his/her gift. <br />

		<br /><span id="player1-output"></span> had to pretend he/she liked it, even though it was the worst.<br />

		<!-- (large obj) -->
		<br />Then <span id="player3-output"></span> took over the party playlist and played nothing but Elton John. It infuriated <span id="player4-output"></span> and he/she threw a/an <span id="large-output"></span> at the stereo. Completely destroying both.<br />

		<!-- (ugly obj) -->
		<br /><span id="player1-output"></span> was especially looking forward to the cake. When the cake came out the bakery has drawn a/an <span id="ugly-output"></span> on it. What the fuck!<br />

		<!-- (soft obj) -->
		<br /><span id="player1-output"></span> clutched his/her favorite <span id="soft-output"></span> and cried.<br />
